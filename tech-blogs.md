* [Our evolution towards T-REX: The prehistory of experimentation infrastructure at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/our-evolution-towards-t-rex--the-prehistory-of-experimentation-i):
  * LinkedIn Targeting, Ramping, and Experimentation platform (T-REX) enables 41,000 A/B tests simultaneously on a user population of over 700 million members.
  * In order to develop an A/B testing platform, you must start with defining four main capabilities of the system, namely:
    * Evaluating whether a member belongs to or is eligible for an A/B test.
    * Assigning a member to a specific variant of the test. 
    * Propagating information about the tests and their definition to a production environment and recording information about members’ participation in the test.
    * Computing A/B reports and measuring the test’s impact.
